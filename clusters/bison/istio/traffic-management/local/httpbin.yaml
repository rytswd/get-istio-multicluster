  # üç∑ TODO üç∑: Ingress Gateway is definitely receiving the traffic, but it's not routed to the endpoint target.
  # This seems to be caused by either gateway matching is not working, or host informaiton not matching.
  # The internal mesh sidecar routing works.
  # Also, adding a star in the host field does nothing. It seems to imply that the gateway is not being matched.
